## Assignment

### Easy version: Build the Google homepage.

### Assignment

#### Easy Version: Build the [Google.com](http://www.google.com) homepage

(the simple one with just a search box).

Inside your project folder, create your index.html file

1. Tips:
   - DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST! You're just trying to make it _look_ like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn't have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.
   - USE GOOGLE! You'll probably run into roadblocks where you can't figure out how to do something so do what all good devs do... Google it!
   - Now is a good time to [set up the live server extension](https://youtu.be/mGORIVStWWc) in VSCode, if you haven't already.
   - If you're frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style the way you want (for instance, they seem to just not respond to any styles), look into the CSS property `-webkit-appearance: none;` or `-moz-appearance` if you're using Firefox.
   - [Here's a link to the Google Logo just in case they temporarily replace it with a Doodle!](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)
   - [Here's a cached page of the Google home page for reference in case the original logo is not there.](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/)
2. Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your `<img>` tag.
3. Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. Check out [how to build a horizontal CSS navbar](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp) if you're lost.
4. Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
5. In general, do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page's source code) to help you along.
6. Push your project to GitHub using the instructions above!

### Introduction

For this mini-project, you'll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don't worry if the links don't go anywhere and the search box doesn't do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you've actually tried to "build" something in HTML (very exciting!).

Using the browser's developer tools (right-clicking something on the page and clicking "inspect element" will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out (or try using [CodePen](http://codepen.io/pen/) or [jsfiddle.net](http://www.jsfiddle.net)).

### Try These Before Starting

These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
1. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
1. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
1. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
1. Center an element horizontally
1. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
1. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
1. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)
